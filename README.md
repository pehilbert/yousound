# YouSound

## How to Run
To run the app, you will need to install Node.js and npm.

First, clone this repo to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/pehilbert/yousound
```
Then, you will need to install all the dependencies. To do this, navigate to the root directory of the project and run:
```
npm install
```
Navigate to the `frontend` and `server` directories and run the same command.

Now, navigate back to the root directory.

Before running the app, you will need to set the environment mode. To do this, run either `npm run set-dev` or `npm run set-prod` for
development and production mode respectively. You can also just run `npm run dev` or `npm run prod`.

In development mode, it will run the React app on a test server on port 3000, and the main server separately on port 5000. When ran, a browser window should open
automatically, but if not, the app can be accessed via http://localhost:3000 (or the actual URL to the server)

In production mode, it will build the React app into static content, which the main server will serve directly, running on on port 5000. The app can be accessed
via http://localhost:5000 (or the actual URL to the server)

The current version of mongodb we are using is 6.0.17. Make sure to install mongobd as well as the mongodb dotenv dependency. Then create a database for instance my name is yousound the command is 'use yousound'. You must then run the command 'mongosh' and 'db.mycollection.insertOne({ name: "example", type: "demo" })' the second command is necessary to write to establish the database and tell mongo that this database "can be used".

 **Example Of Database Setup**
 
	mongosh

	use mydatabase

	db.mycollection.insertOne({ name: "example", type: "demo" })

	show dbs

You will also have to set the environment variables for both the frontend and server. To do this, copy the ".env-template" files in both directories and rename them to ".env". Set all the required fields to what they need to be. If they are already filled in, there is mostly no need to change them, but be sure to fill in the ones that are left blank. These tend to be the more sensitive fields, and of course, they are required in order for the app to work. They are found in the /yousound/server/ and /yousound/frontend/. 

Once everything is set, run `npm start` in the root directory to run the app. (Or, again, you can just run `npm run` and then `dev` or `prod`)
